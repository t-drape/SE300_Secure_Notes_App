SDD Template

1. Introduction and Purpose:

The System Under Development (SUD) is a local, command-line-based secure notes application designed to provide users with a privacy-focused method for creating, managing, and analyzing personal notes. The SUD enables users to create new notes, read previously saved notes, append additional content, delete existing notes, and generate AI-based summaries and keyword analyses of selected notes. The primary purpose of the SUD is to ensure that all user-generated note content remains confidential and protected against unauthorized access. To achieve this, all notes are encrypted using AES-256 encryption before being written to the host computer’s storage. Encryption keys are derived from a user-provided password using the PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) algorithm. Decryption occurs only in memory when explicitly requested by the user, and plaintext content is never stored persistently on disk. The SUD operates entirely offline and requires no external servers, databases, or cloud services. All functionality is executed locally on the host computer (HC) through a menu-driven command-line interface (CLI). The system is designed to be minimalistic, secure, and modular, with a clear separation of concerns between file management, encryption, authentication, and AI-based analysis components.
