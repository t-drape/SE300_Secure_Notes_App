Notes from Initial SRD Review:

Split non-atomic requirements into several atomic requirements
Add feature-specific requirements for encryption/decryption
Add runtime requirements for database functionality
Add non-functional requirements
Rearrange requirements for better document flow
Remove repeated requirements in feature list
Describe product usage in feature list instead of creating formal requirements
Move requirements from wrong domain sections
